<p>i'm <b>rasha lama</b>.</p>
<p>i live in montreal where i walk a lot. i get out of bed to feed Maple (my cat) or to get a coffee (on my walk). the best cafe is pikolo, but i'm currently a frequent at replika and reine.</p>
<p>i read the pile of books on my bedroom floor. there are stacked under a candle. i'm currently reading Huxley's Brave New World, before ending my long visit in Hesse' mind with his final game, before entering Whitehead's whole new world.
<p>i write here and there. i sketch when no words can be found. i once wrote about writing and titled it <a href="/onwriting.pdf">"On Writing"</a>
    </iframe> i also wrote many-a-times about flowers and so tied a bouquet of paper as <"flowers & letters."</a>
