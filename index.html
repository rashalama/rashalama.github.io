      <p>I create because I think a bit too much beyond capacity, where thoughts must explore themselves in materials and forms beyond intuition and reason.
        </br></br>I am based in Montréal with occasional runs to New York City for matters of the mind. I am a recent <a
        href="https://www.mcgill.ca/desautels/programs/bcom/academics/areas-study/sustainability/major" target="_blank"><u>McGill University</u></a> graduate who has found a calling in
        poetry that is <i>lived.</i> That is to say that I have played with dirt,
        plants, books, ink, paper, and words enough so to have deferred my entry to RISD’s three-year <a
        href="https://www.risd.edu/academics/landscape-architecture/masters-programs" target="_blank"><u>Master of Landscape
        Architecture</u></a> program. In the meantime, I give my role as an honest human being to a living organism by the
        name of <a href="http://www.studiogaia.com/" target="_blank"><u>Studio Gaia</u></a>, a world-renowned interior design firm based in New York City.
        </br></br>Beyond, I write. It is a vocation, as in I have no choice but to write. Perhaps due to the overthinking, over
        observing, but also the strange feeling of foreign eyes wherever I am. To expand, I come from mixed Arab roots. I am
        majority Palestinian, with both sides fleeing to Jordan during both ‘48 & ‘67 wars. With a German <i>oma</i> and Armenian <i>teta</i>,
        I grew up in the train station of Abu Dhabi and the suburbia of Toronto, and yet found my first home in Montréal.
        Therefore, I am lost more than just in thoughts; but in the very least, I have signed a lease in Montréal with a shelf of my
        copious black-bound Moleskines that have been home for 7 years. It is here that I shall be for a little while, to walk the streets,
        read in parks, and create in my very home of creaky floors and slanted doors.
